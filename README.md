### Download App
  1. Download zip file
  2. Open terminal and navigate into folder

### Create Firebase Account
  2. Create a free Firebase account at https://firebase.google.com

  3. Create a project from your Firebase account console

  4. Add a connection to firebase on your front end
    1. Click the “Add Firebase to your web app” icon
    2. Copy the contents WITHOUT SCRIPT TAGS or the CDN from the resulting popup into `public/scripts/config.js`. It should look like this:

    ```
      javascript
        // Initialize Firebase
        var config = {
          apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
          authDomain: "XXXXXXXXXXXX.firebaseapp.com",
          databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com",
          storageBucket: "XXXXXXXXXXXX.appspot.com",
          messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXX"
        };
        firebase.initializeApp(config);
    ```

    5. Add a firebase service account to you node project
      1. Navigate to the [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) tab in your project's settings page.
      2. Select your Firebase project.
      3. Copy your `databaseURL` from the `Admin SDK configuration snippet`. The line you need will look like this: `databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com"`.
      4. Navigate to the `server/modules/decoder.js` file in the node project and replace the databaseURL. Only replace that line. It is inside of the `admin.initializeApp`:

        ```javascript
        admin.initializeApp({
          credential: admin.credential.cert("./server/firebase-service-account.json"),
          databaseURL: "https://XXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com" // replace this line with your URL
        });
        ```
      5. Return to firebase [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk). Navigate to your project again if you have left it.
      6. Click the Generate New Private Key button at the bottom of the Firebase Admin SDK section of the Service Accounts tab.
      7. Rename the new JSON file to `firebase-service-account.json` and save it in the `server` folder of your application.

    6. Return to Firebase console. Configure Google as an authentication provider for your Firebase project.
      1. In the Firebase console for your project (you may already be there from the previous step), click "Authentication" in left panel
      2. Click "Set Up Sign-In Method" button
      3. Select "Google"
      4. Click the "edit" icon
    5. Toggle Google to `on`
